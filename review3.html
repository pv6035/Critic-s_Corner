                        <b>Fresh</b> is a darkly comedic thriller that takes a unique approach to modern dating and the perils that come with it. Directed by Mimi Cave, the film stars Daisy Edgar-Jones as Noa, a young woman navigating the often terrifying landscape of contemporary romance.

                    <p class="review-text">
                        The film's premise revolves around Noa's unexpected relationship with Steve, played by Sebastian Stan, who initially seems charming and perfect. However, as the story unfolds, it delves into much darker themes that challenge the notions of trust and consent in relationships.

                    <p class="review-text">
                        Cave's direction keeps the audience on their toes, mixing humor with horror elements that create a suspenseful atmosphere. The performances are engaging, particularly Edgar-Jones, who brings depth to her character's transformation. <b>Fresh</b> is a clever and thought-provoking take on the horrors of dating, making it a must-watch for those who enjoy genre-bending films.

                        While the plot may not break new ground, the emotional depth brought by the characters adds a layer of complexity to the story. Hemsworth delivers a compelling performance, balancing brute strength with vulnerability. <b>Extraction</b> is a must-watch for action enthusiasts and showcases the best of modern action filmmaking.
